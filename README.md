### Projects
### Pricing European Call Options using the Black-Scholes Equation
[Report](https://github.com/kasvinatirumal/wdrp_wi25/blob/main/Pricing_European_Call_Options.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook (Python)
- Modeled stock prices mathematically, and used the model to estimate historical volatility of stocks.
- Explored the differences between pricing European call options using historical and implied volatility.
- Compared estimated prices to their respective market price.
- Examined implied volatility curves of real-world call options.

### Are Economic Indicators and Per Capita CO2 Emissions Good Predictors of HDI?
[Report](https://github.com/kasvinatirumal/predicting-hdi/blob/main/project.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook (Python)
- Explored the relationships between per capita GDP, carbon dioxide emissions and HDI, and plotted their respective trends from 2010 to 2022 using an interactive visualization.
- Investigated whether HDI varies significantly across different levels of per capita carbon dioxide emissions.
- Trained a linear regression model and an XGBoost model to predict HDI using only economic indicators.
- Added per capita carbon dioxide emissions as a predictor to both models, which improved the model’s predictive accuracy.
- Concluded that the hyperparameter-tuned XGBoost model, with recursive feature elimination of five predictors and the inclusion of CO2 emissions as a predictor, was the most accurate model for predicting HDI.

### COVID-19 Vaccination Appointment Scheduler
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kasvinatirumal/vaccine-scheduler/tree/main/src/main), coded using Java and SQL

Developed a Java-based command-line application for scheduling COVID-19 vaccination appointments. The application interacts with a Microsoft Azure-hosted database, utilizing SQL to create, manage, and query tables for Caregivers, Availabilities, Vaccines, Patients, and Appointments.
